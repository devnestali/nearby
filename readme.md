# 🗺️ NEARBY

Nearby is a mobile application that allows its users to find restaurants, cinemas, stores and other places closest to their location. The application was developed using the city of São Paulo as an example, for residents near Paulista Avenue. By clicking on the location, the user can read information about it and read a QR Code, in this case present at the establishment, to obtain discounts through a coupon.
